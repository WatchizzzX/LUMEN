## Intro
This is an game with a top view in which you play as a robot and solve logic puzzles based on logical operators.

## Tech Stack

- Unity 2023.2.0f1

## Features

- Interaction with all standard logical operators
- Platformer gameplay

## Process
I am creating this game as part of my thesis project. The theme I have selected is learning, as I am studying to become a programmer. The game will contribute to this area in a positive way.
Although the game is intended for people with no prior experience and who wish to expand their horizons in the area of programming and solving logical problems, it may be more suitable for those with less programming knowledge. Initially, the game was planned to be in first-person view, but the design has since shifted to isometric.
During the brainstorming process, we added features such as interacting with objects in order to solve puzzles based on physical principles (similar to Portal), as well as the ability to program small drones to perform various tasks using Lua, allowing even those without prior programming experience to complete the game.
