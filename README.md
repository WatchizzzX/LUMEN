## Intro
This is an isometric game with a top view in which you play as a robot and solve logic puzzles based on logical operators.
## Tech Stack

- Unity 2023.2.5f1
- FMOD for Unity


## Features

- Interaction with all standard logical operators
- Platformer gameplay
- The ability to program inside the game in Lua Script

## Process
I'm developing this game for my thesis. The topic I have chosen is learning. Since I am studying to be a programmer, the game will teach in this area. Although it is more suitable for those who have never tried it and want to try to expand their thinking towards programming and making consistent solutions for logical problems. Initially, this game was supposed to be FPV, but after that the concept changed to an isometric style.  Also, during brainstorming, ideas were added for interacting with objects to solve physics-based puzzles (as in Portal), as well as programming small drones, but executing various commands using Lua, which would allow even a person who had no programming experience to complete the game.
